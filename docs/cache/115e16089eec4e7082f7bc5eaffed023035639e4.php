<p>In Laravel, panel actions are functions or methods that can be used to perform specific tasks within the Laravel admin panel. These actions are usually associated with a specific model or resource, and can be used to perform operations such as creating, updating, deleting or viewing the model or resource.</p>

<p>Panel actions are typically used in the Laravel admin panel to provide users with quick and easy access to common tasks related to a particular model or resource. For example, a panel action might be used to quickly create a new user account, edit an existing user's details, or delete a user account that is no longer needed. Panel actions are typically implemented as buttons or links within the admin panel, and can be customized to fit the specific needs of a project.</p>
